        Template to use pdflatex
        ------------------------

The pdflatex can be used to create pdf or dvi files. Default mode is pdf. 
In dvi mode pdflatex is a replacement for the latex. To set the latex mode use

pdflatex --output-format dvi filename

NB: latex uses graphics .epc
pdflatex uses graphics formats .png, .pdf, .jpg or .mps

To use this template rename it and replace the name of the picture file 
latex_example_pic to your picture file name. 
It's recommended do not specify picture file name extension at all. By default 
(see "The Not So Short Introduction to LATEX 2epsilon.pdf", chapter 4.7.7): 

LaTEX will look for .eps, and pdfLaTEX will try to include a file with the 
extension .png, .pdf, .jpg or .mps (in that order).

Settings for the command :make in the .vimrc:

" set makeprg=latex\ %	" to latex file in the current window
set makeprg=pdflatex\ --output-format\ dvi\ %	" to latex file with pdflatex in the current window
" set makeprg=pdflatex\ %	" to pdflatex file in the current window
